# MedASR Notebooks

*   [Quick start with Hugging Face](quick_start_with_hugging_face.ipynb) - This
    notebook demonstrates how to quickly get started with MedASR, Google's open
    Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model fine-tuned for the medical domain.
    It shows how to load the MedASR model from Hugging Face and use the
    transformers library pipeline to perform speech-to-text transcription on an
    example audio file.

*   [Quick start with Model Garden](quick_start_with_model_garden.ipynb) - This
    notebook demonstrates how to use MedASR as a service deployed on
    [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/overview).
    It shows how to use the service API to perform speech-to-text transcription
    in online or batch workflows.

*   [Fine-tune with Hugging Face](fine_tune_with_hugging_face.ipynb) - This
    notebook shows how to fine-tune the model locally using Hugging Face
    libraries.
